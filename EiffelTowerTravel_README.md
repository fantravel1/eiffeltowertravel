Coverage includes:
- Ticket types, entry routes, elevator vs stairs logic
- Best times for views (day, sunset, sparkle hours)
- Photography angles & “where to stand” guides

- Neighborhood deep dives (7th, 16th, Champ de Mars, Trocadéro)

No outdated ticket info.  
No crowd-blind itineraries.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

EiffelTowerTravel is **not a booking site**.  
It is a **landmark-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- generate itinerary variants (time, budget, mobility)
- translate and localize instructions
- cluster recommendations by intent (views, food, romance, kids)
- produce “decision trees” for ticket strategy

Humans are required to:
- verify ticket and access logic
- validate crowd and safety guidance
- keep venue/pricing info current
- ensure cultural respect and neutrality

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

EiffelTowerTravel is built around **landmark-centered entities**.

### Core Entities
- Landmark Node (Eiffel Tower)
- Ticket Type / Access Method
- Viewpoint / Photo Spot
- Restaurant / Café / Picnic Spot
- Neighborhood
- Walking Route
- Itinerary
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by time, distance, and intent
- is programmatically generatable
